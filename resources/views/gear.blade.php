                        I am using <span class="text-primary">Canon M50 Mark II</span> for short time, I bought it because it is under the offer, and my budget was is low,
                        the next camera I think I will buy, it's my love <span class="text-primary">Canon 5D mark IV</span> or if I was rational I'll search about the canon mirrorless cameras for now maybe <span class="text-primary">Canon EOS R</span>.                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-2">
                        I like to use fewer lenses, I have a <span class="text-primary">canon 50mm f1.8</span> it is a nice lens shep and good, it's the first lens I buy ever, and from that day to today.
                        the lens I want to get is <span class="text-primary">Canon 24-70mm f2.8</span> it is a great lens, it has a wide aperture and fast autofocus a focal length more than enough for me.
